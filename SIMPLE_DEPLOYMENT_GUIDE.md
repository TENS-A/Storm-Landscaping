# How to Get Your Website Live - Simple Guide

## The Quick Version

Your website is ready to go live. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (free code storage)
2. **Deploy to Netlify** (free hosting)
3. **Connect your domain** (the website address you own)
4. **Done!** Your contact form will work automatically

## Step 1: Save Your Code to GitHub

GitHub is like a cloud storage for your website code.

1. Go to **[GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and create a free account
2. Click the **+** icon in the top right → **New repository**
3. Name it `storm-landscaping`
4. Click **Create repository**
5. Copy the commands GitHub shows you and paste them into your terminal (ask your developer if you need help with this step)

That's it! Your code is now backed up on GitHub.

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

Netlify is a free hosting service that makes your website live on the internet.

1. Go to **[Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and click **Sign up**
2. Click **Sign up with GitHub** and authorize it
3. Click **New site from Git**
4. Select your `storm-landscaping` repository
5. Click **Deploy site**

Netlify will build your site and give you a temporary URL (like `your-site.netlify.app`). Your website is now live!

**Important:** Your contact form will start working automatically at this point.

## Step 3: Connect Your Domain

This is the step that makes your website appear at your custom domain (e.g., `stormlandscaping.co.uk`).

### If you already own a domain:

1. In Netlify, go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `stormlandscaping.co.uk`)
4. Netlify will show you some DNS information
5. Go to wherever you registered your domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
6. Find the DNS settings and add the information Netlify gave you
7. Wait 24-48 hours for the domain to connect

### If you don't have a domain yet:

1. In Netlify, go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **Add custom domain**
3. Search for a domain name you like
4. If it's available, buy it through Netlify
5. It will automatically connect to your site

---

## Step 4: Test Everything

Once your domain is connected:

1. Visit your website at your domain name
2. Click "Get Quote" or "Request a Quote"
3. Fill out the form and submit it
4. Check your email - you should receive the submission
5. Test on your phone to make sure it looks good

---

## That's It!

Your website is now live with a working contact form. Every time someone fills out the form, you'll get an email.

## Making Changes Later

If you want to update your website:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Push the changes to GitHub
3. Netlify automatically redeploys your site
4. Changes go live within a few minutes
